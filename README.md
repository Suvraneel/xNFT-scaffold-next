## Getting Started

- Create a project using this example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suvraneel/xNFT-scaffold-next
cd xNFT-scaffold-next
code .
```

- Remove `.example` from `.env.example` and add your RPC endpoint to `NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_URL=""`  

- Install dependencies & start buidling:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

or  

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```  

or  

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm run dev
```

---

- Production Build  

```bash
npm run build #or yarn build or pnpm run build (accordingly)
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
If you want to add a new page you just create another file in `src/app/*` folder - Have a look at `nfts/page.tsx` as an example.

On `src/contexts/*`, you'll find `AllProvider` for all provider contexts (eg, ToastProvider), and "WalletProvider" wrapping your app, this is necessary for everything to work.
